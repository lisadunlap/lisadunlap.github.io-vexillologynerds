<b>Terminology</b>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<u>Obverse:</u> in western tradition, this is the side of the flag that you see when the flagpole is on the left - we normally think of it as the flag's front.

<u>Reverse:</u> this is the opposite side of the flag from the obverse, the side you see when the flagpole is on the right -we normally think of it as the flag's back.

<u>Ratio:</u> the ratio of the height of a flag to its length - the USA national flag is 10:19, the UK national flag is 3:5. Proportion is another term used to compare height to length.

<u>Hoist:</u> this is the half of the flag nearest the flagpole.

<u>Fly:</u> this is the half of the flag furthest from the flagpole; the fly edge is the edge furthest from the flagpole, and the part of a flag most likely to wear away.

<u>Canton:</u> this is the top-half of the hoist, so the top-left corner when illustrated in western style, with the flagpole on the left - it is the most significant part of the flag.

<u>Device:</u> this is anything that appears on the flag, from a simple geometric shape, such as a cross or star, to an animal or plant. Also known as a charge.

<u>Division:</u> this is when the flag is divided into different colored areas, such as three stripes, or diagonally.
