<b>Terminology</b>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<u>Obverse:</u> in western tradition, this is the side of the flag that you see when the flagpole is on the left - we normally think of it as the flag's front.

<u>Reverse:</u> this is the opposite side of the flag from the obverse, the side you see when the flagpole is on the right -we normally think of it as the flag's back.

<u>Ratio:</u> the ratio of the height of a flag to its length - the USA national flag is 10:19, the UK national flag is 3:5. Proportion is another term used to compare height to length.

<u>Hoist:</u> this is the half of the flag nearest the flagpole.

<u>Fly:</u> this is the half of the flag furthest from the flagpole; the fly edge is the edge furthest from the flagpole, and the part of a flag most likely to wear away.

<u>Canton:</u> this is the top-half of the hoist, so the top-left corner when illustrated in western style, with the flagpole on the left - it is the most significant part of the flag.

<u>Device:</u> this is anything that appears on the flag, from a simple geometric shape, such as a cross or star, to an animal or plant. Also known as a charge.

<u>Division:</u> this is when the flag is divided into different colored areas, such as three stripes, or diagonally.

<b>Basics</b>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. When designing a flag remember that it will fly in the wind and is not just a rectangular design on paper - so
think what the flag will look like when flying in a brisk breeze and when hanging down on a still day.

2. Simplicity is important in creating a design that is easy to recognize and simple to reproduce. Try re-drawing the
design freehand to see whether an imperfect drawing of the flag can still be easily identified. Also try imagining
it at a small size, such as a lapel pin, or when viewed from a distance, when small details will not be obvious.

3. A flag needs to be distinctive to stop it being mistaken for another. Compare it to neighboring and similar flags
to check that they are not easily confused.

4. If you want a flag to remain popular for a long time, it should look as “timeless” as possible, to make it immune
to changing fashions. Avoid using features in the design that will cause the flag to become dated or obsolete,
e.g., a reference to farming could be timeless but depicting a particular style of tractor will date very quickly.
Imagine the flag in a historic setting and in a very modern setting to check whether it would work in both.


<b>Color</b>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Using fewer colors will keep the design simple and bold.

2. Contrast is important - use light colors on dark, and vice-versa. So a white cross on red is good contrast, but a
blue cross on red would be a poor contrast. This is a very useful guideline, especially for choosing the color of
devices and their background. If the use of non-contrasting colors is unavoidable, make use of outline colors
(fimbriation) where, for instance, a dark cross on a dark background is outlined with a light one – an example of
this is the flag of the Åland Islands, part of Finland.

3. Modern printing techniques have made many more shades available - if there is a specific color that is connected
to an area or organization then that should be considered. It may be useful to match colors to those already used
in other national or regional flags. If you wish your flag to be made by traditional applique techniques (i.e.,
sewn together from different pieces of fabric), then bear in mind that the range of colors available in flag fabric is
much more limited.

4. The edges of a flag need to be defined so that it stands out from its environment. For example the blue Scandinavian
cross on Finland’s national flag allows the edges of the flag to be seen even if the sky is full of white
clouds.

<b>Structure</b>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The way a flag flies means the hoist is more visible when waving in the wind and hanging at rest, than the fly.
The most prominent parts of a flag are in the center or in the canton. Devices that are placed in the fly of a flag
are often obscured when the flag is hanging limply, so this is best avoided.

2. As flags are normally wider than they are tall (i.e., “landscape”), a design that is taller than it is wide (i.e., “portrait”)
will tend to look squashed and leave a lot of empty space on each side - so the design will need careful
balancing.

3. Avoid having a different design on the reverse of the flag as this will undermine recognition and make the flag
much more expensive to manufacture.



<b>Devices</b>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. A single device should be placed to ensure that it will be seen with the flag in flight or at rest, preferably in the
most prominent position.

2. Where more than one device is placed on a flag, different background colors can be used to “anchor” the device
within the overall flag design.

3. Devices should be graphical representations rather than realistic pictorial depictions (e.g., a simplified tree
rather than a realistic drawing of a particular tree) so that people unfamiliar with the specific entity represented
can still understand what is being referred to (e.g., the castle on Edinburgh's city flag is not remotely an accurate
representation of Edinburgh Castle).

4. Use of writing on a flag defeats its purpose - one might simply write the name of a country or location on a
white sheet and wave it around. In any case it is very difficult to read any writing on a flag when it is flying in
the wind, or hanging down, and it appears backwards on the reverse of the flag (unless the flag is made doublesided,
greatly increasing the cost and complexity of manufacturing the flag). The challenge is to create a flag that
can symbolize an entity and be immediately recognizable without recourse to inscriptions or legends. Parade
Banners and Military Colors have a different function and are usually displayed more rigidly and closer up to
the observer, allowing for writing to be used.

5. Traditionally, the flagpole of a flag is considered the leading edge, so on vehicles the flag is painted with the
flagpole at the front, as if the flag is streaming behind it in the wind of the vehicle’s passage. This has led to devices
which themselves have a direction being shown moving towards the flagpole. So most animals on flags
face to the left on the obverse. In heraldry an animal facing to the right can indicate cowardice, as in running
away.

6. Seals, coats-of-arms, and logos are usually too complex to use as a device on a flag; after all many are designed
expressly to be viewed up-close and are difficult to reproduce. It is better to use an element from these devices
as a reference to the whole.


<b>Symbolism</b>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The symbols on a flag should be both distinct and representative. Including an emblem that is specific to the
locality it represents makes the flag both meaningful and unique.

2. A flag should represent the totality of any particular community rather than individual parts of it. Using a device
or emblem associated with one specific location within a broader region renders the flag ineffective as a
regional representation; but beware of the complexity that can be created by having a device for each part of a
community.

3. A flag should emphasize its own identity over that of any higher level grouping, otherwise the distinctiveness of
each design is lost, as for example in the flags of the former Soviet republics.

4. Only include symbolic references to other entities if there is a clear, direct relevance.

5. Avoid representing any particular feature in multiple ways; opt instead to make one definitive reference.
