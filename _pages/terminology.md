<b>Obverse:</b> in western tradition, this is the side of the flag that you see when the flagpole is on the left - we normally think of it as the flag's front.

<b>Reverse:</b> this is the opposite side of the flag from the obverse, the side you see when the flagpole is on the right -we normally think of it as the flag's back.

<b>Ratio:</b> the ratio of the height of a flag to its length - the USA national flag is 10:19, the UK national flag is 3:5. Proportion is another term used to compare height to length.

<b>Hoist:</b> this is the half of the flag nearest the flagpole.

<b>Fly:</b> this is the half of the flag furthest from the flagpole; the fly edge is the edge furthest from the flagpole, and the part of a flag most likely to wear away.

<b>Canton:</b> this is the top-half of the hoist, so the top-left corner when illustrated in western style, with the flagpole on the left - it is the most significant part of the flag.

<b>Device:</b> this is anything that appears on the flag, from a simple geometric shape, such as a cross or star, to an animal or plant. Also known as a charge.

<b>Division:</b> this is when the flag is divided into different colored areas, such as three stripes, or diagonally.
